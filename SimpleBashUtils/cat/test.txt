	I usually have four meals a day. In the morning I have breakfast.
At school I have lunch. At home I have dinner and in the evening I have supper.







	Besides, I like to eat an apple or a banana, or to drink a glass of juice between meals, if I'm thirsty.







	Yesterday I got up at 7 o'clock, washed, cleaned teeth and dressed.










	Then I had breakfast. I had mashed potatoes with meat, a cheese sandwich and
a cup of tea for breakfast. At school we had a pie and a glass of orange juice.







	I'm always hungry when I come home after school. Yesterday my mother, cooked cabbage soup,
roast chicken and rice, made pudding and tea. It was so tasty. I ate everything with pleasure.
