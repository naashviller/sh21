What is a Regular Expression in C?

	Regular Expressions or Regexes are used to represent a particular pattern of a
string or some text, it consists of a string of characters, and are used to discover
search patterns inside the target string. Each character in the regex or a regular
expression is either a character having a literal meaning ie. it can be either a char
from the set of a to z or 0 to 9 or some meta character that has its special meaning.

	For example - A regular expression of the form b[a-z] can have the values ba,
bb, bc, etc. Here b is the literal character, and the set [a-z] says any lowercase letter
between a and z should be the next character both included, the square brackets [] here
indicate that the value enclosed inside them is a variable value and whose value is based
on the character set written inside it, meaning it can be any possible char value from the
given character set.

	Almost every programming language supports regex, in fact, if we normally talk about
most the text processing applications like lexers, advanced text editors, and some rich markdown
editors they as well use regex as a use case of string matching.

	Regex is extensively used in string matching or similar workflow applications or for
validating inputs. Validating inputs means, suppose we are writing a program in which we only
want to accept integer values from the user, then for that we can put a condition inside the
scanf() function in the following way scanf("%[0-9]", &data); and because of this restriction
the program will only accept the values from the set of 0-9 and will discard every other invalid
input, sounds simple? even if this is seeming to be a lot at the start, no worries we will be
writing very simple and to-the-point programs for every possible case mentioned in this article,
so let's move forward and try to understand, what are patterns in the POSIX library.

	Patterns in POSIX Library

	Regex is not the property of any particular language, rather it is a term in which a
sequence of characters is used to match a pattern in any given target string. Talking about
POSIX is a widely known library in the C language and most of its classes are present inside
the regex.h header file and are primarily used for the implementation of regular expressions.

	Let's have a look at the below table, here we are having various POSIX classes and with
respect to them, their character equivalent representations and their follow-up descriptions are
given explaining what each class will return as a match.
