Syntax of Regex

The general syntax used for creating and compiling regular expressions in C is,
regcomp(&regex, expression, flag);

It takes three compulsory arguments.

	regex - pointer to the memory region where the expression is matched and stored,
meaning after the successful execution of the regcomp() function, the function
will compile the regular expression contained in the expression argument and
will store that to the memory location pointed by the pointer regex.

	expression - pointer to a pattern of type string
flag - specifies the type of compilation, we generally pass this value as 0.
Return Value

	The function returns the value 0 if the compilation of the regex is completed
successfully and will return Error_code if the compilation was not successful.
